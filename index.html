      <h1>Areas for Growth</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="well">
      <h3>Networking</h3>
      <p>I want to work on being more proactive about networking, and more generally, just talking with others who are working in the same field as me. I'm definitely an introverted person and just the idea of going out to events after work is tiring. One
        of the main reasons I joined Epicodus was that I knew it would force me into speaking with other people and hopefully make me a little more comfortable in conversations. I know that I still have a lot of room to grow in this area and need to continue
        pushing myself outside of my comfort zone. I've registered for a couple of meetups in the past, but have not actually managed to bring myself to attend any of them. For the next meetup I will be attending (details below), I will be finding a buddy
        to go with me to add a bit of accountability.</p>
      <p>Improving engagement on LinkedIn is another step that I want to take. Although, my LinkedIn profile was already 100% complete, I discovered on Friday, that there were other areas of my account that needed attention. For instance, there is a "signal"
        feature that you can toggle to let recruiters know that you are actively looking for a job. I also updated my career interests, which gets broadcast to recruits with the signal and added a job search alert, so that I will recieve weekly emails
        about jobs posted on LinkedIn that match my criteria. I'll be attending a meetup event on Oct 12 hosted by The Code Academy entitled "Maximizing Your LinkedIn" in order to learn other ways I might improve my LinkedIn account. Lastly on Friday,
        I reached out to a contact who I didn't know on LinkedIn who was looking for an intern for Salesforce. He wrote back to inform me that I was overqualified for the position, but I'm glad that I took the opportunity to reach out to an unknown contact
        on LinkedIn for the first time.</p>

      <h3>Learn more about Salesforce Development<h3>
      <h4>Tools</h4>
      <p>Since my plan is to work in Salesforce development, I'll need to figure out the best tools available for doing work in that platform. Salesforce has it's own built-in developer console, but most people say that it's pretty limited in it's capabilities and recommend using a 3rd party IDE instead. I've done some research and have identified 2 good free options: Mavensmate extension for Atom and Sublime (Mavensmate is a Salesforce consulting firm) and JedIDE plugin for IntelliJ. Not only are these two of the most highly recommended tools for Salesforce development, but they're applications that I already have experience with through Epicodus. I have already installed Mavensmate for Atom, connected to a free Salesforce developer org, and have started working through a simple development project.</p>
      <h4>Learning Apex, VisualForce, and Lightning Components</h4>
      <p> Apex is Salesforce's programming language, very similar to Java, for doing back-end data operations, and VisualForce and Lightning Components are views of data that utilize a Javascript controller. At Epicodus I've acquired a solid understanding of concepts like object-oriented programming, MVC architectural pattern, SQL, etc. that will give me a good jumping off point to understand what I'm reading as I try to learn development in the Salesforce platform. My first step toward learning Salesforce development will undoubedtly be to go through the <a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/users/00550000006yDdKAAU/trailmixes/build-your--developer-career-on-salesforce">Salesforce Deverloper Trailhead</a>. Through this process, I will be able to complete several projects in my own Salesforce deverloper sandbox to get hands-on experience with coding in the platform. There are other resources as well, suchs as <a href="http://www.sfdc99.com/">sfdc99</a> that have a lot of good tutorials and resources for learning to code in Apex. I also want to start reaching out to salesforce developers and admins who have made the switch to development to learn more about the career path. There is a Salesforce-specific developer group in Portland that I will be participating in in the future in order to build connections with folks who have already learned how to do what I want to do. Lastly, I know that over the long-term I'll be doing most of my learning on the job. It's important to me that I find a job where I can work with other Salesforce experts that I can learn from, instead of as a solo administrator or developer or as a remote employee.</p>

      <h3>Working with others</h3>
      <p>I've discovered through this class that under certain circumstances, I really struggle emotionally with working with others. In particular, when I'm working with a strong-willed partner who prefers to be in the driver seat I can become aggravated over time, either because I feel like I'm not getting the opportunity to try out my ideas or because the space is being physically dominated (control of keyboard, chair alignment with monitor, etc.) by my partner, causing me to feel marginalized.</p>

      <p>Now that I know everyone in the class and their workstyle, I've made an effort to readjust my expectations everyday based on what I know about my partners work style. If my partner is more assertive, I resign myself early on to being in the passenger role. I feel that this works for a certain amount of time, but as the day wears on I'll usually start to feel frustrated again. Another aspect of pair-programming that I can find frustrating is that I feel that it typically slows down the process of getting a project done. Found this 4-part story: <a href="https://collectiveidea.com/blog/archives/2016/07/21/how-to-become-a-better-pair-programmer-part-one">How to become a better pair programmer</a>
      <ul>
        <li>"know which hill to do die on"--if you're going to bring up a point of disagreement with your partner, make sure it's something that actually matters. Don't allow the disagreement to become personal.</li>
        <li>when in the passenger seat there are plenty of things to keep you busy and engaged in the project--"shoulder-surfing for typos or logic errors, searching the web for solutions to problems that crop up, communicating with the broader team, and performing other tasks on my own computer". I particularly like the idea of having a second computer on hand to lookup solutions to problems--I've done this a good amount on my phone.</li>
        <li>"assume the best"--give your partner the benefit of the doubt, and don't take things personally</li>
        <li>expect pair programming to take more time than programming by yourself (approximately 1.5x more time for the same functionality). Pair programming is supposed to result in project getting completed faster, but should result in higher-quality code.</li>
      </ul>
