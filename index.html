      <h3>Learn more about Salesforce Development<h3>
      <h4>Tools</h4>
      Since my plan is to work in Salesforce development, I'll need to figure out the best tools available for doing work in that platform. Salesforce has it's own built-in developer console, but most people say that it's pretty limited in it's capabilities and recommend using a 3rd party IDE instead. I've done some research and have identified 2 good free options: Mavensmate extension for Atom and Sublime (Mavensmate is a Salesforce consulting firm) and JedIDE plugin for IntelliJ. Not only are these two of the most highly recommended tools for Salesforce development, but they're applications that I already have experience with through Epicodus. I have already installed Mavensmate for Atom, connected to a free Salesforce developer org, and have started working through a simple development project in the Salesforce beginner developer Trailhead in.

      <h3>Working with others</h3>
      <p>I've discovered through this class that under certain circumstances, I really struggle emotionally with working with others. In particular, when I'm working with a strong-willed partner who prefers to be in the driver seat I can become aggravated over time, either because I feel like I'm not getting the opportunity to try out my ideas or because the space is being physically dominated (control of keyboard, chair alignment with monitor, etc.) by my partner, causing me to feel marginalized.</p>

      <p>Now that I know everyone in the class and their workstyle, I've made an effort to readjust my expectations everyday based on what I know about my partners work style. If my partner is more assertive, I resign myself early on to being in the passenger role. I feel that this works for a certain amount of time, but as the day wears on I'll usually start to feel frustrated again. Another aspect of pair-programming that I can find frustrating is that I feel that it typically slows down the process of getting a project done. Found this 4-part story: <a href="https://collectiveidea.com/blog/archives/2016/07/21/how-to-become-a-better-pair-programmer-part-one">How to become a better pair programmer</a>

        <ul>
          <li>"know which hill to do die on"--if you're going to bring up a point of disagreement with your partner, make sure it's something that actually matters. Don't allow the disagreement to become personal.</li>
          <li>when in the passenger seat there are plenty of things to keep you busy and engaged in the project--"shoulder-surfing for typos or logic errors, searching the web for solutions to problems that crop up, communicating with the broader team, and performing other tasks on my own computer". I particularly like the idea of having a second computer on hand to lookup solutions to problems--I've done this a good amount on my phone.</li>
          <li>"assume the best"--give your partner the benefit of the doubt, and don't take things personally</li>
          <li>expect pair programming to take more time than programming by yourself (approximately 1.5x more time for the same functionality). Pair programming is supposed to result in project getting completed faster, but should result in higher-quality code.</li>
        </ul>

      I want to work on being more proactive about networkingâ€”reaching out to people on LinkedIn and attending events where I can meet new folks. This morning I reached out to a contact on LinkedIn who was looking for an intern for Salesforce. He wrote back to inform me that I was overqualified for the position, but I'm glad that I took the opportunity to reach out to an unknown contact on LinkedIn for the first time.





      Turned "signal" feature on to let recruiters know that I'm looking for a job, and updated my career interests. Added job search alerts.



      Find the time to attend local events





      Avoid getting overwhelmed
